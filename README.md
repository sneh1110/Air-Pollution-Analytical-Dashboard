# Air Pollution Monitoring and PM2.5 Prediction Dashboard
The Air Pollution Monitoring and PM2.5 Prediction Dashboard is an essential tool in the proactive management of air quality and public health. By effectivelyintegrating real-time data collection from various monitoring sources withadvanced predictive modeling techniques, the dashboard provides a robustframework for forecasting PM2.5 concentrations. This predictive capability iscrucial, as PM2.5 particles are known for their adverse health impacts,penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and potentially leading to severerespiratory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and premature death.

Usage:
The utility of this dashboard extends beyond simple monitoring; it acts as adecision-support tool enabling policymakers, environmental agencies, and thepublic to take timely and informed actions. For instance, it can guide theimplementation of emergency measures during high pollution episodes, assist inurban planning, and help in the evaluation of long-term policies aimed atemission reduction. Moreover, it increases public awareness and engagement byproviding accessible and understandable pollution data.

Algorithmic Approach
The grayscale output of the algorithm provides a detailed representation of elevation variations, where lighter shades signify higher elevations and darker shades correspond to lower elevations. The refined image is not only visually informative but also serves as a basis for subsequent analysis.

To enhance the interpretability of the results, the algorithm produces both grayscale and colorized representations of the processed image. The grayscale version maintains a nuanced portrayal of elevation differences, while the colorized version employs a gradient mapping technique.

The inner grid is having elevation of 255 which is a pit 
the outer grid is having elevation of 240 then 200 then 150 and 100.
so the pits are bordered and the colours dipict the 8 different directions.

This mapping assigns distinct colors to specific elevation ranges, aiding in the quick and intuitive identification of elevation levels.

This innovative flood-fill algorithm is a valuable tool for terrain analysis, hydrology, and related fields. Its ability to transform raw elevation data into visually compelling representations facilitates a deeper understanding of the landscape and supports the identification of potential water flow paths. The algorithm's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from environmental monitoring to landscape modeling and beyond.
